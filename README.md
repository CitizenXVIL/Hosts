* Link: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CitizenXVIL/Hosts/master/Optimized_hosts_list.txt

   - Ran modified script to reduce the size of the list by eliminating redundant domains from Expanded_hosts_list. Additional wildcards were also added.

## Add-on Lists
* Link: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CitizenXVIL/Hosts/master/Youtube%20hosts.txt

   - Experimental list to attempt to block YouTube video ads. This is based on information from Pi-Hole discussion boards about YouTube ad blocking. This is highly unlikely to work because YouTube uses continuously changing subdomains, and blocking all the subdomains can affect mobile playbcack.
