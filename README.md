   - [Bjorn Stormberg](https://github.com/bjornstar/hosts)
   - [StevenBlack's ad-hoc list](https://github.com/StevenBlack/hosts)
   - [AdGuard Simplified domain names filter](https://kb.adguard.com/en/general/adguard-ad-filters#domains)
   - [AdGuard Mobile ads filter](https://kb.adguard.com/en/general/adguard-ad-filters#mobile)
   - [Malware Domain List](http://www.malwaredomainlist.com/hostslist/hosts.txt)

## Main lists
* Link: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CitizenXVIL/Hosts/master/Expanded_hosts_list.txt
   - Ran original mmotti script with default domains plus adguard's simplified host list
   - Short link: https://bit.ly/2KhySZ3
   
* Link: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CitizenXVIL/Hosts/master/Optimized_hosts_list.txt
   - Ran modified script to create an optimized version of the Expanded_hosts_list. Additional wildcards and regex removals were also added.

## Add-on Lists
* Link: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CitizenXVIL/Hosts/master/Youtube%20hosts.txt
   - Experimental list to attempt to block YouTube video ads. This is based on information from Pi-Hole discussion boards about YouTube ad blocking. This is highly unlikely to work because YouTube uses continuously changing subdomains, and blocking all the subdomains can affect mobile playbcack.
   - Short link: https://bit.ly/2KvfXKS

* Link: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CitizenXVIL/Hosts/master/mobile%20domains.txt
   - Mobile ad/tracker list based on AdGuard's mobile ad filter.
   - This list is automatically processed and generated by a script.
